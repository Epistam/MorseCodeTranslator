# MorseCodeTranslator

## Purpose
This repository is a submission to ESIEA Paris' technical association, DTRE, for their FlaminCode 2018 50th week's challenge.

## Goals
This challenge's goal is to make a Morse Code <-> Latin Alphabet translator. Bonus points for originality and code size.

## Remarks
This code is largely overkill compared to the requirements. I just wanted to get some code done with the UI so that I could finally reuse in other projects instead of shamelessly postponing its realization forever.
